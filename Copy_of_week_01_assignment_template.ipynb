        "    - Importing the data, as well as unzipping the file, was fairly easy. The data files were labeled clearly and the instructions clearly marked out which data file was supposed to go on which map. When I went to add data to the map, that button was also easy to find. Rearranging the layers was simple, so I would rate this experience a 9/10.\n",
        "  - Map creation and annotation\n",
        "    - This was a little more difficult than simply inputting the data. Most of the map creation process I really enjoyed, and I liked all of the different features for the different colors and shapes to choose from that allows for customization. I got a little bogged down in the super technical details, like finding how to change the font size on text boxes or adjusting the scale bar, but managed to figure it out. I struggled the most with choosing the correct size of the map to put on the layout and getting the frame to be the right size. Overall, I would rate this part a 7/10.\n",
        "  - Navigate the software using its GUI\n",
        "    - This was a little difficult for me since I'm not super familiar with computer technology in general, but I really enjoyed having the super detailed document to help me along. I think once I get more comfortable with the program, I will be able to use it without the instructions, too. Overall, 8/10."
